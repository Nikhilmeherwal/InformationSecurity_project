In recent times, the introduction of information technology and e-health
care system in the medical eld helps clinical experts to provide better
health care to the patient. Brain tumor is one of the major causes for the
increase in mortality among people. To detect infected tumor tissues from
medical imaging modalities, segmentation is employed. This project is aim to
implement Nature-inspired meta-heuristics algorithms to detect brain tumor.
A previously used algorithm is used to prepare a comparative study with a
non-implemented algorithm in the eld of brain segmentation.
